About
======
This is a work in progress twitch bot that operates on the client side through a react frontend. Currently it allows for use of three modules: whoami, haiku, and echo. I will continue to add modules and functionality. 


Live Demo
======

This project currently requires an oauth key. Hopefully I will get around to baking this into the app. For now visit [this](https://twitchapps.com/tmi) website to obtain yours. In the field of the app that requires the oauth key, ensure you are omitting the "oauth:" from the key. 


Modules
======

### whoami
Returns the username of the sender

### echo
Echos the text sent

### haiku
Prints a haiku
